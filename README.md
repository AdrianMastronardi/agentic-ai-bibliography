# Agentic AI Bibliography

**Agentic AI** ‚Äîthe design and deployment of systems capable of autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and coordinated action‚Äî is quickly emerging as one of the most transformative frontiers in artificial intelligence. From multi-agent collaboration to tool-using LLMs, from workflow orchestration to memory and planning strategies, the ‚Äúagent‚Äù paradigm is reshaping how we build intelligent systems.

Yet, as excitement grows, so does confusion. A flood of tutorials, demos, and hype-driven posts often oversimplify complex ideas, reduce architecture to boilerplate, and blur the line between experimentation and production-ready design. Worse, some teams may take a "just follow this YouTube video" approach to building agents‚Äîwithout the depth, structure, or critical thinking that real-world implementation demands.

This **Agentic AI Bibliography** aims to provide a grounded, evolving reference point. It is not a traditional bibliography. It includes academic papers, books, videos, open-source tools, industry use cases, evaluation benchmarks, design patterns, and conceptual texts. It is meant for:

- **Engineers** building agentic systems in production.
- **Researchers and architects** exploring multi-agent design, reasoning loops, and planning.
- **Product and innovation teams** wanting to separate signal from noise in a rapidly shifting landscape.
- **Anyone** seeking to understand what it really takes to build AI systems that reason, act, and collaborate.

This is not a finished product. It is a living document‚Äîand an invitation. Contributions, critiques, and suggestions are welcome. Let‚Äôs raise the floor of what we consider best practice, and collectively build a foundation that goes beyond shortcuts.

- **Yutaro Yamada et al. ‚Äì *The AI Scientist-v2: Workshop-Level Automated Scientific Discovery via Agentic Tree Search* (2025)**
  This paper introduces The AI Scientist-v2, an end-to-end agentic system capable of autonomously generating scientific hypotheses, designing and executing experiments, analyzing data, and authoring manuscripts. Notably, it produced the first entirely AI-generated workshop paper accepted through peer review. The system employs an agentic tree-search mechanism guided by an experiment manager agent, demonstrating significant advancements in automated scientific research.

### 7.5 Lifelong Autonomy and Open-Ended Environments

Agents that operate autonomously in open-ended environments, learning new skills over time without fixed task boundaries. These systems highlight challenges in exploration, memory, and continuous adaptation ‚Äî key frontiers for agentic AI.

- **Voyager**
  Originally covered in [Section 3](#3-evaluation-and-benchmarks), Voyager demonstrates an autonomous LLM-based agent operating in Minecraft. Its ability to learn skills over time and adapt to unstructured environments makes it one of the most complete agentic applications to date.

## 8. Critical Perspectives and Futures

Agentic AI opens new technological possibilities‚Äîbut also new questions. What kinds of labor do agents replace or reinforce? Who designs their goals, and who bears their consequences? This section gathers essays, papers, and perspectives that critically examine the development and deployment of agentic systems. It includes reflections on labor, power, bias, evaluation limits, speculative risks, and long-term trajectories. These works are essential for those who not only build agents, but question what kind of world they help build.

### 8.1 Social, Philosophical and Planetary Critiques  

- **Sherry Turkle ‚Äì *Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other* (2011)**
  Turkle explores how digital technologies, particularly social robots and online communication, are reshaping human relationships. She warns that while these technologies offer the illusion of companionship, they may erode our capacity for empathy and authentic connection.

- **Cathy O‚ÄôNeil ‚Äì *Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy* (2016)**
  O‚ÄôNeil exposes how opaque, large-scale algorithmic models‚Äîused in hiring, credit, policing, and education‚Äîreinforce structural inequalities and evade accountability. Her critique highlights the urgent need for transparency and ethical oversight in automated decision-making systems.

- **Virginia Eubanks ‚Äì *Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor* (2018)**
  Eubanks examines how automated decision systems used in welfare, housing, and criminal justice disproportionately target and penalize low-income communities. Her analysis underscores the need to evaluate agentic systems based on their real-world social impact.

- **Jaron Lanier ‚Äì *Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now* (2018)**
  Lanier argues that algorithmic platforms extract value from human behavior while undermining empathy, free will, and democratic dialogue. While not specific to agents, his critique of persuasive computation and behavior manipulation is deeply relevant to agentic interfaces deployed in real-world systems.

- **Kate Crawford ‚Äì *Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence* (2021)**
  Crawford exposes how artificial intelligence is deeply entangled with extractive practices, labor exploitation, and surveillance infrastructures. Her book reframes AI as a material and political system, not just a technical achievement‚Äîan essential perspective for anyone designing or deploying agents at scale.

- **James Bridle ‚Äì *Ways of Being: Animals, Plants, Machines: The Search for a Planetary Intelligence* (2022)**
  Bridle challenges the anthropocentric view of intelligence by exploring cognition across various forms of life and machines. He advocates for a broader understanding of intelligence that includes non-human entities, urging a more equitable coexistence with all forms of life.

### 8.2 Technical Criticism and Evaluation Reform

- **Emily M. Bender et al. ‚Äì *On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?* (2021)**
  This landmark paper critiques the uncritical scaling of large language models, emphasizing risks such as embedded bias, environmental cost, and opacity. It calls for research practices that center transparency, accountability, and social responsibility‚Äîprinciples fundamental to the development of agentic AI.

- **Sayash Kapoor et al. ‚Äì *AI Agents That Matter* (2024)**
  This paper identifies major gaps in current evaluation practices for AI agents, arguing that many existing benchmarks fail to reflect real-world usefulness. The authors propose a principled framework for measuring agent performance in terms of utility, reproducibility, and decision impact.

- **Arvind Narayanan & Sayash Kapoor ‚Äì *AI Snake Oil: What Artificial Intelligence Can Do, What It Can‚Äôt, and How to Tell the Difference* (2024)**
  Narayanan and Kapoor critically examine the overhyped claims surrounding AI technologies. They distinguish between areas where AI can be truly impactful and those where it is ineffective or misleading. This work is essential for anyone trying to separate meaningful progress from marketing-driven illusion.

### 8.3 Speculative Risks and Long-Term Futures

- **Nick Bostrom ‚Äì *Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies* (2014)**
  Bostrom examines potential trajectories for artificial general intelligence, outlines catastrophic risk scenarios, and proposes governance frameworks. This is a foundational work for understanding long-term AI risks and designing preventive strategies.
