## Introduction

**Agentic AI** —the design and deployment of systems capable of autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and coordinated action— is quickly emerging as one of the most transformative frontiers in artificial intelligence. From multi-agent collaboration to tool-using LLMs, from workflow orchestration to memory and planning strategies, the “agent” paradigm is reshaping how we build intelligent systems.

Yet, as excitement grows, so does confusion. A flood of tutorials, demos, and hype-driven posts often oversimplify complex ideas, reduce architecture to boilerplate, and blur the line between experimentation and production-ready design. Worse, some teams may take a "just follow this YouTube video" approach to building agents—without the depth, structure, or critical thinking that real-world implementation demands.

This **Agentic AI Bibliography** aims to provide a grounded, evolving reference point. It is not a traditional bibliography. It includes academic papers, books, videos, open-source tools, industry use cases, evaluation benchmarks, design patterns, and conceptual texts. It is meant for:

- **Engineers** building agentic systems in production.
- **Researchers and architects** exploring multi-agent design, reasoning loops, and planning.
- **Product and innovation teams** wanting to separate signal from noise in a rapidly shifting landscape.
- **Anyone** seeking to understand what it really takes to build AI systems that reason, act, and collaborate.

This is not a finished product. It is a living document—and an invitation. Contributions, critiques, and suggestions are welcome. Let’s raise the floor of what we consider best practice, and collectively build a foundation that goes beyond shortcuts.

> 📌 **Format Note**  
> Each entry in this bibliography follows a consistent format: a brief description summarizing the contribution, followed by inline links to available resources.  
> - The structure is: **Author – *Title* (Year)**, abstract, and links to internal or external sources.  
> - All links are placed at the end of the paragraph for clarity and compactness.  
> - Entries are grouped by theme to guide exploration.

## 1. Foundational Concepts

To build truly agentic systems, we must revisit the early visions that treated the computer not just as a tool, but as a thinking partner. These foundational texts shaped the original dream of human-computer symbiosis.

- **J.C.R. Licklider – *Man-Computer Symbiosis* (1960)**  
  A visionary essay that imagines a future where humans and computers collaborate closely, each doing what they do best. Licklider argues that progress in computing would come not from automation, but from symbiosis—interactive systems that augment human thought.

- **Douglas Engelbart – *Augmenting Human Intellect* (1962)**  
  A foundational report proposing the use of computers to amplify human intelligence. Engelbart lays out principles that would later lead to the invention of the mouse, hypertext, and interactive computing. Essential reading to understand the original ethos behind building systems that empower human agency. [Read the full paper from this repo](./papers/engelbart-augmenting-human-intellect.pdf).
