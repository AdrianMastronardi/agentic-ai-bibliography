## Introduction

**Agentic AI** —the design and deployment of systems capable of autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and coordinated action— is quickly emerging as one of the most transformative frontiers in artificial intelligence. From multi-agent collaboration to tool-using LLMs, from workflow orchestration to memory and planning strategies, the “agent” paradigm is reshaping how we build intelligent systems.

Yet, as excitement grows, so does confusion. A flood of tutorials, demos, and hype-driven posts often oversimplify complex ideas, reduce architecture to boilerplate, and blur the line between experimentation and production-ready design. Worse, some teams may take a "just follow this YouTube video" approach to building agents—without the depth, structure, or critical thinking that real-world implementation demands.

This **Agentic AI Bibliography** aims to provide a grounded, evolving reference point. It is not a traditional bibliography. It includes academic papers, books, videos, open-source tools, industry use cases, evaluation benchmarks, design patterns, and conceptual texts. It is meant for:

- **Engineers** building agentic systems in production.
- **Researchers and architects** exploring multi-agent design, reasoning loops, and planning.
- **Product and innovation teams** wanting to separate signal from noise in a rapidly shifting landscape.
- **Anyone** seeking to understand what it really takes to build AI systems that reason, act, and collaborate.

This is not a finished product. It is a living document—and an invitation. Contributions, critiques, and suggestions are welcome. Let’s raise the floor of what we consider best practice, and collectively build a foundation that goes beyond shortcuts.
