# Agentic AI Bibliography

**Agentic AI** ‚Äîthe design and deployment of systems capable of autonomous reasoning, decision-making, and coordinated action‚Äî is quickly emerging as one of the most transformative frontiers in artificial intelligence. From multi-agent collaboration to tool-using LLMs, from workflow orchestration to memory and planning strategies, the ‚Äúagent‚Äù paradigm is reshaping how we build intelligent systems.

Yet, as excitement grows, so does confusion. A flood of tutorials, demos, and hype-driven posts often oversimplify complex ideas, reduce architecture to boilerplate, and blur the line between experimentation and production-ready design. Worse, some teams may take a "just follow this YouTube video" approach to building agents‚Äîwithout the depth, structure, or critical thinking that real-world implementation demands.

This **Agentic AI Bibliography** aims to provide a grounded, evolving reference point. It is not a traditional bibliography. It includes academic papers, books, videos, open-source tools, industry use cases, evaluation benchmarks, design patterns, and conceptual texts. It is meant for:

- **Engineers** building agentic systems in production.
- **Researchers and architects** exploring multi-agent design, reasoning loops, and planning.
- **Product and innovation teams** wanting to separate signal from noise in a rapidly shifting landscape.
- **Anyone** seeking to understand what it really takes to build AI systems that reason, act, and collaborate.

This is not a finished product. It is a living document‚Äîand an invitation. Contributions, critiques, and suggestions are welcome. Let‚Äôs raise the floor of what we consider best practice, and collectively build a foundation that goes beyond shortcuts.

> üìå **Format Note**  
> Each entry in this bibliography follows a consistent format: a brief description summarizing the contribution, followed by inline links to available resources.  
> - The structure is: **Author ‚Äì *Title* (Year)**, abstract, and links to internal and external sources.  
> - All links are placed at the end of the paragraph for clarity and compactness.

## 1. Foundational Concepts

To build truly agentic systems, we must revisit the early visions that treated the computer not just as a tool, but as a thinking partner. These foundational texts shaped the original dream of human-computer symbiosis.

- **Vannevar Bush ‚Äì *As We May Think* (1945)**  
  A prophetic essay written at the end of World War II, envisioning a machine‚Äîthe ‚ÄúMemex‚Äù‚Äîthat would extend human memory and association through technology. Bush‚Äôs vision laid the conceptual groundwork for hypertext, digital knowledge systems, and ultimately the notion of interactive intelligence augmentation. A foundational text for understanding AI not as replacement, but as partnership. [Read the full paper from this repo](./papers/bush-as-we-may-think.pdf).

- **J.C.R. Licklider ‚Äì *Man-Computer Symbiosis* (1960)**  
  A visionary essay that imagines a future where humans and computers collaborate closely, each doing what they do best. Licklider argues that progress in computing would come not from automation, but from symbiosis‚Äîinteractive systems that augment human thought.

- **Douglas Engelbart ‚Äì *Augmenting Human Intellect* (1962)**  
  A foundational report proposing the use of computers to amplify human intelligence. Engelbart lays out principles that would later lead to the invention of the mouse, hypertext, and interactive computing. Essential reading to understand the original ethos behind building systems that empower human agency. [Read the full paper from this repo](./papers/engelbart-augmenting-human-intellect.pdf).

- **Don Norman ‚Äì *The Design of Future Things* (2007)**  
  A seminal exploration of how intelligent systems should interact with humans‚Äînot through control, but through communication and understanding. Norman anticipates the challenges of designing proactive, semi-autonomous technologies, emphasizing the importance of feedback, transparency, and the psychology of interaction. A must-read for thinking about AI agents not just as tools, but as social actors.

- **Sherry Turkle ‚Äì *Alone Together* (2011)**
  A sociological and psychological exploration of how digital agents reshape our sense of intimacy and self. Turkle raises critical questions about emotional delegation to machines and warns against the illusion of companionship without relationship. Essential for thinking critically about agents as social actors, not just functional tools.

- **Joon Sung Park, Joseph O'Brien, Carrie J. Cai, Meredith Ringel Morris, Percy Liang, Michael S. Bernstein ‚Äì *Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior* (2023)**  
  A groundbreaking study in which generative agents‚Äîpowered by LLMs‚Äîsimulate believable human behavior in an interactive sandbox world. This work bridges human-computer interaction, cognitive simulation, and agent design, offering deep insight into how artificial agents might exhibit memory, planning, and social dynamics. A must-read for understanding the expressive and interactive potential of agentic systems. [Read the full paper from this repo](./papers/park-generative-agents.pdf).

- **Fei-Fei Li ‚Äì *The Worlds I See* (2024)**  
  A personal and reflective account of Fei-Fei Li‚Äôs journey as a scientist and AI leader. While not a technical manual, this book offers a powerful vision of Human-Centered AI‚Äîframing intelligence not just as a computational challenge, but as a profoundly human endeavor. Recommended for those seeking to ground Agentic AI systems in ethical, emotional, and societal context.
