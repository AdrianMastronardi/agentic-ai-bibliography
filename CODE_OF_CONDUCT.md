# 📜 Code of Conduct

This community is dedicated to building a thoughtful, rigorous, and inclusive reference on Agentic AI. We welcome curiosity, disagreement, and debate—but expect all interactions to remain respectful and constructive.

## ✅ Expected Behavior

- Be **kind and respectful**. Critique ideas, not people.
- Engage in **good-faith discussion**. Assume others want to improve the field, just like you.
- Provide **evidence, reasoning, and references** when challenging claims or suggesting changes.
- Help others understand: **explain your thinking**, not just your conclusions.
- Keep contributions **relevant** to the project's scope: agentic systems, architectures, evaluation, tools, and critical perspectives.

## 🚫 Unacceptable Behavior

- Personal attacks, name-calling, or dismissive tone.
- Gatekeeping or elitism—**everyone learns by engaging**.
- Off-topic promotion or spam.
- Plagiarism or adding copyrighted content without permission.

## 🤝 Enforcement

We believe most issues can be resolved with a reminder or clarification. Repeated or egregious violations may result in removal from the discussion board or revocation of contribution rights.

If you experience or observe behavior that violates this code, please contact a maintainer privately.
