# ðŸ”’ Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This project is primarily a curated bibliography. It does not contain executable code or host a service.

However, if you believe you've found a **security issue** (e.g., malicious links, file upload risks, or unsafe embedded code), please:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Instead, contact us privately at: [your-email@example.com]

We take all reports seriouslyâ€”even in content-only repositories.

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- Uploaded files (e.g., PDFs or scripts)
- Third-party links included in entries
- Any future tooling or automation included in the repo

If a report relates to software linked from this repository but not maintained here, we recommend contacting the original project maintainers directly.

Thank you for helping us keep this project safe and trustworthy.
